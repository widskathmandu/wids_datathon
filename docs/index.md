## Data challenge this year
This years' Datathon focuses on tackling global climate change problems. The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption. Participants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions. <br><br>

## When, Where and How?
The workshop session will be held on **February 04, 2022** virtually via zoom. Please register **[Here]**() to participate. We will help you understand the dataset, introduce you to exploring the dataset, build predictive models, and use the Kaggle platform. The session is open to all genders with little or no prior experience tackling real-world data science problems. <br><br> Feel free to communicate with other participants and form a team to submit your solution to the WiDS data challenge in Kaggle. You can find a timeline to participate in global challenge **[here]**(https://www.widsconference.org/datathon_details.html)
