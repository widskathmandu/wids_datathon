## Data challenge this year
This years' Datathon focuses on tackling global climate change problems. The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption. Participants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.
